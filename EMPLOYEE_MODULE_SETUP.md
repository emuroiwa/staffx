# Employee Management Module - Setup Complete! 🎉

## ✅ **Issue Resolved: lodash-es dependency**

The error `Failed to resolve import "lodash-es"` has been fixed by installing the missing dependency:

```bash
npm install lodash-es
npm install --save-dev @types/lodash-es
```

## 🔧 **What Was Installed:**

1. **lodash-es** - ES modules version of lodash for debounce functionality
2. **@types/lodash-es** - TypeScript type definitions

## 🛠 **Alternative Solutions (if you prefer not to use lodash-es):**

### **Option 1: Use our custom debounce utility**
Replace this import in EmployeeList.vue, PositionList.vue, and DepartmentList.vue:
```javascript
// Replace this:
import { debounce } from 'lodash-es'

// With this:
import { debounce } from '@/utils/debounce'
```

### **Option 2: Inline debounce function**
```javascript
// Add this method directly in the component:
const debounce = (func, wait) => {
  let timeout
  return function executedFunction(...args) {
    const later = () => {
      timeout = null
      func.apply(this, args)
    }
    clearTimeout(timeout)
    timeout = setTimeout(later, wait)
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **How to Start Using:**

1. **Ensure your Laravel backend is running:**
   ```bash
   # In your Laravel project directory
   php artisan serve --port=8001
   ```

2. **Start your frontend development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test API connectivity (optional):**
   ```bash
   # Check if the API configuration is correct
   node test-api-config.js
   ```

4. **Navigate to the Employee module:**
   - Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click "Employee Management" in the sidebar
   - Explore Employees, Positions, Departments, and Organogram

5. **Test the features:**
   - ✅ Add a new employee using the 4-step modal
   - ✅ Search and filter employees
   - ✅ View employee details
   - ✅ Manage positions and departments

## 🔧 **API Configuration:**

The Employee Module is now properly configured to communicate with your Laravel backend:

### **Current Configuration:**
- ✅ **API Base URL:** `http://localhost:8001/api` (configured in `.env`)
- ✅ **Authentication:** Bearer token automatically added to all requests
- ✅ **Request/Response Interceptors:** Automatic token refresh and error handling
- ✅ **Proper Headers:** Content-Type and Accept headers set correctly

### **API Service Features:**
- ✅ **Automatic Authentication:** Includes Bearer token from localStorage
- ✅ **Token Refresh:** Automatically refreshes expired tokens
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of 401 errors with redirect to login
- ✅ **Concurrent Request Handling:** Prevents multiple refresh attempts

### **Environment Variables:**
```bash
# .env file
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001/api
```

## 📋 **Backend API Endpoints Expected:**

The frontend now properly calls these Laravel API endpoints:

### **Employee Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/employees` - List employees with filters
- `POST /api/employees` - Create employee
- `GET /api/employees/{uuid}` - Get employee details
- `PUT /api/employees/{uuid}` - Update employee
- `DELETE /api/employees/{uuid}` - Delete employee
- `GET /api/employees/statistics` - Get employee statistics
- `GET /api/employees/export` - Export employees
- `GET /api/employees/potential-managers` - Get potential managers

### **Position Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/positions` - List positions
- `POST /api/positions` - Create position
- `GET /api/positions/{id}` - Get position details
- `PUT /api/positions/{id}` - Update position
- `DELETE /api/positions/{id}` - Delete position

### **Department Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/departments` - List departments
- `POST /api/departments` - Create department
